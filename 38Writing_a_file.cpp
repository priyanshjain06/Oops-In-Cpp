// These are some useful classes for working with files in C++

// fstreambase
// ifstream --> derived from fstreambase
// ofstream --> derived from fstreambase

// In order to work with files in C++, you will have to open it. Primarily, there are 2 ways to open a file:

// Using the constructor
// Using the member function open() of the class

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string st = "Zingling Hahahahaha ";

    // Opening files using constructor and writing it
    ofstream out("1_Sample.txt"); // Write operation
    out << st;

    return 0;
