# Pillars of OOPS (C++ / Java) — Placement Exam Ready

These are core theory questions in MCQs, viva, and interviews.

---

## 1️⃣ Encapsulation

### Meaning

Binding data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access.

### How achieved

* Using classes
* Using access specifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`)

---

## 2️⃣ Inheritance

### Meaning

One class acquires properties and behavior of another class.


# Abstraction

## 📖 What it means

Showing only essential features and hiding implementation details.

---

## 🔧 How it is achieved

* **Abstract class**
* **Pure virtual functions**

---

---

# Polymorphism

## 📖 What it means

**One name, many forms** — same function behaves differently.

---

## 🎯 Types

### 🔹 Compile-time polymorphism

* Function overloading
* Operator overloading

### 🔹 Runtime polymorphism

* Function overriding
* Virtual functions
